About
=====

This document contains TDCI standards for the structure, format, processing, and exchange of data.

These standards:

…are *community-developed and -maintained*.
   If you are a provider or user of TDC data, you are part of this community, and your contributions are welcome and encouraged!
   To raise or propose changes to the source text of this page, you can
   `start or join a discussion <https://github.com/orgs/transport-data/discussions>`_,
   `file an issue <https://github.com/transport-data/tools/issues>`_, or
   `open a pull request <https://github.com/transport-data/tools/pulls>`_ for review.

…use key words from `RFC 2119 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.html>`_ to indicate *requirement levels*.
   These include words in boldface like **must** / **required**; **should** / **recommend(ed)**; and **may** / **optional**.
   Taken together, data and/or processes that fulfill all the ‘required’ standards can be considered “TDC formatted”.
   Data that also fulfill all the recommended and optional standards represent *best practices*.

…are implemented by TDCI itself.
   TDCI processes, the TDC infrastructure, the code in this :mod:`transport_data` Python package, and TDCI data products such as “TDCI Harmonized” data serve as examples best-practice implementation of these standards.

…build on and connect to other standards (instead of duplicating or reinventing them).
   For instance, for the ``GEO`` code list, TDCI does not define a new list of codes or names, but incorporates `ISO 3166 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166#Parts>`_ by reference.

…aim to be *complete* and *precise*.
   In practice this means the standards are quite long, and examples are deliberately kept short.
   TDCI develops and supports community development of tutorials, guides, explainers, in multiple languages and media, targeted to different audiences, that help with the adoption of these standards.
   These **must** promote a correct implementation of the standards, and **may** give more detailed and elaborate examples.

Definitions
===========

See `Concepts for transport data <https://paul.kishimoto.name/transport-data-concepts/>`__.
These reference many terms from **ISO 17369 Statistical data and metadata exchange (SDMX)** (`sdmx.org <https://sdmx.org>`_), specifically Section 2 — Information Model (SDMX-IM).
See `Standards <https://sdmx.org/?page_id=5008>`__ on the SDMX web site.

.. todo:: Incorporate that text in this page or another.

Maintainable artifact
   Any artefact/object in the SDMX-IM that is associated to a Maintainer.
   Includes, among others: data flows, data structures, and item schemes (code lists, concept schemes, agency schemes).

Entities
--------

TDCI
   …is the collection of people affiliated with TDC, either as individuals or representatives or organizations.

Data categories
---------------

These standards concern four broad categories of data:

Public data
   Data from open public repositories collected and aggregated by TDCI for ease of access.

   The TDC standards do not govern these data; to the contrary, TDCI processes **must** accommodate different formats etc. that result from legitimate differences in the practices of data subjects and providers.
Community data
   Data contributed directly to the TDC by TDCI participants or community members—either individuals or organizations.

   The TDC standards provide **optional** and **recommended** but *not* mandatory requirements for these data.
TDC formatted or -compliant
   Data in SDMX formats that meet the minimum requirements below.
TDCI Harmonized
   Data products prepared by the TDCI through transforming and merging data from multiple sources (including the 3 above categories), with validation and other quality control measures applied.

   These data **must** meet the mandatory, recommended, *and* optional requirements in this document.

These categories are not exhaustive: for instance, there are others including **proprietary** (non-public) data.
The TDC standards only mention these where relevant.

Structures and metadata
=======================

Maintainers
-----------

Every maintainable artifact **must** be associated with a specific maintainer.

The maintainer **must** include at least one :class:`~sdmx.model.common.Contact` with at least the :attr:`~sdmx.model.common.Contact.name`, and :attr:`~sdmx.model.common.Contact.email` attributes, for the person(s) responsible for preparing the (meta)data in TDC formats.
It **should** include additional contacts, including:

- People responsible for preparing original (meta)data.
- Authors of publications to which the data are associated.
- Fallback/organizational contacts, in case the above people leave the organization.

Annotations
-----------

The TDCI identifies the following IDs for SDMX annotations that can be attached to any :class:`~sdmx.model.common.AnnotableArtefact`.
If used, annotations with these IDs **must** conform to the given requirements:

``tdc-concept``
   Identifies a TDC concept/dimension.
   See :ref:`dsd`, below.
``tdc-generated``
   Date, time, and version of the :mod:`transport_data` code used generate the object.

   Example: `2023-05-11T21:42:55.760130 by transport_data v0.1.dev63+g92a2aac.d20230511`

   The function :func:`.anno_generated` generates such an annotation and **should** be called on all objects created in this package.

Codes
-----

Any code list intended for reuse (with multiple data structures and flows) **should** include one or more of the following:

- ``_T``: Total, no breakdown, or a sum across all other codes.
- ``_X``: Not specified.
- ``_Z``: Not applicable.

.. _dsd:

Data structures
---------------

Data structures that describe TDC formatted data flows **should** reflect the original or full dimensionality and attributes of the data.

TDCI Harmonized data structures **must** use the following IDs for dimensions and attributes, if they appear in data. [2]_
TDC formatted data **should** use the IDs; but if not **must** include a ``tdc-concept`` annotation that indicates one of the following, so that the data can be automatically transformed.

``GEO``
   Geographical area.
   Sometimes called "country", "region", "economy", "ISO [3166 alpha-2 or alpha-3] code".
``TIME_PERIOD``
   Primary time dimension.
``UNIT_MEASURE``
   Units of measurement.

.. [2] These IDs follow the practice of major data providers and the SDMX Global Registry.

Data
====

TDC formatted data **must** be provided together with structure information and metadata, as described above.
In other words, an SDMX DataMessage without accompanying SDMX StructureMessage(s) is *not* TDC formatted.

Processes
=========

Community data
--------------

Data **should** be published in a durable archive. [1]_
One such archive is `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org>`_: data archived in Zenodo is given a permanent DOI that—unlike ordinary websites—is guaranteed to be resolveable in the future.

Providers **may** choose to publish data in more than one location; if so, they **should** minimize or prevent differents between the data available from each location, or at least clearly document those differences.
They **may** do this by linking to the durable archive.

.. [1] The TDC infrastructure will eventually serve as such an archive, but it is not yet operational.

TDC formatted data
------------------

Providers of TDC formatted data **should** develop tools or code to reproducibly, automatically convert data from their original formats to SDMX.

Such tools **should**:

- be open source and free to use.
- be concise, documented, and readable.
  One way to achieve this is to *use functions and utilities* from the :mod:`transport_data` package directly, instead of duplicating such code.
- where the original data are ambiguous (for example: tabular formats that mix key values, attribute values, and observation values), distinguish dimensions from attributes.
- where the original data provide idiosyncratic or missing IDs: apply the dimension and/or attribute IDs listed above under :ref:`dsd`.
