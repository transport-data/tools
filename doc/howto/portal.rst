Create records using the TDC portal
***********************************

`portal.transport-data.org <https://portal.transport-data.org>`_ provides a web interface for updating and managing data and metadata in the Transport Data Commons.
This guide explains how to create high-quality records using the portal.

Introduction
============

Transport Data Commons data and metadata are stored using the free and open source CKAN software (`documentation/user guide <https://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/user-guide.html>`_, `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CKAN>`__).
The website at `portal.transport-data.org`_ is a **portal** or **front end** designed to make it easy to interact with these (meta)data. [1]_

**Terminology.**

Record
   This guide uses the word **record** to refer to the individual objects contained in TDC/CKAN.
   One way to think of records is to imagine a physical, paper card in a `library catalogue <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_catalog>`_.
   The record may contain information *about* (that is, metadata for) a library holding, but it is not the same thing as the actual book, magazine, or other item.
   Usually the record contains information that you can use to *locate* the actual item.

Dataset
   CKAN and (currently) the TDC portal use the word **dataset** to refer to an individual record.
   This can lead to confusion, because the same word is commonly used with different meanings in different contexts.
   For example:

   - Someone might say “…the ATO *dataset*…” as a colloquial way of referring to the collection of data titled `ATO National Database <https://asiantransportobservatory.org/snd/>`_. A second person might say “…the ATO Infrastructure (INF) *dataset*…” or “…the ATO INF-TTI-008(3) *dataset*…” as a way of referring to portions of the same collection of data.
   - In the context of the SDMX standards that are part of the TDCI :doc:`standards`, there is :ref:`a precise definition <std-defs>` of a “Dataset” as a collection of observations sharing the same structure and measure(s).

Resource
   CKAN's documentation uses this word to refer to **individual files** that are attached to a record.
   There may be zero (0) or more files for each resource.
   In the TDC portal, these appear on the “Downloads” tab of a record page, next to the label “Data and resources”.

Other terms
   - Upstream
   - Downstream
   - Database
   - Data provider
   - Data source

High-quality metadata, among other characteristics:

- Helps make the relationships between different data clear and intelligible.
  For instance, if data in data set B are derived from data set A, good metadata will help a user understand what data from A was used, how it was manipulated or transformed, where it appears in B (and where it does not), etc.
- Is consistent, and thus easy to read, because the information contained by each record is arranged in the same way.
- Makes it easier for users to decide whether data meets their needs.
- Simplifies the work of transforming original data into the more interoperable “TDC formatted” and “TDCI Harmonized” :ref:`categories <std-category>`.

Create a dataset
================

Begin by gathering as much information as you can about the data you intend to record.
You can ask some of the following questions:

- Are you yourself the original creator, publisher, or provider of the data?
  Are you acting on behalf of (an)other person(s) or organization(s) who are?
  Or, are you updating a record with (meta)data *used* by yourself or the TDC community, but provided by someone else?
- What kind of record do you intend to create?
  This can be one of:

  - A **URL-only** record, with no files/resources.
    This is the simplest, easiest, and fastest kind of record to create, and it serves to provide a fixed reference for an upstream source of data that may be used or incorporated in other data that appears in another record.
  - A **mirror** of existing data that already has an authoritative or permanent home elsewhere.
  - A record that will be the first or primary location of the given (meta)data.
  - Something different.

Fill metadata
-------------

Title
   - Use `sentence case <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Sentence_case>`_.
   - If the original data provider gives a title for the data, this **should** match exactly.
     This makes it easier to find the record and confirm the correspondence with the original.
   - If the original data source is a publication, such as an academic journal article, then use the title of the article.
   - **Do not** include the name(s) (full or abbreviated) of the data provider.

Name
   The front-end automatically fills this based on what you enter in the title field.
   You **should** inspect this value and overwrite with something that is both intelligible and short.

   - **Do** omit connection words and common words like 'data', 'dataset', etc.

   Example: if the title is “Vehicle stock data from Transport Starter Data Kits”:

   - Auto-filled name: “vehicle-stock-data-from-transport-starter-data-kits”
   - Improved name: “tsdk-vehicle-stock”

Organisation
   …

Description
   - Write the full description (“Overview”, below) first, and then return to fill this field.

Overview
   - Include an explicit list of all dimensions of the data, their IDs or names, and the codes, values, or labels appearing along each dimension.

   Generally, you should not need to use this.
   The current guide shows how to perform actions through the portal/front-end.
